## Introduction
This game is about managing resources and evolving your valley using them. You can move arround using `WASD` and explore the region. Using numbers `1,2,3` you can switch between your three tools and use them by `left-clicking` on the appropiate resource. 
By pressing the `I` on your keyboard you can open/close the Inventory to see the resources you've collected. Be careful because the size is limited.
Now, you can start doing constructions by `right-clicking` on an empty cell. You can plant vegetables to earn food and if you have enough wood and rock you can start building buildings.
